# Python-Exercises-Summer-2024
A repository for all my Python exercises created during the summer of 2024. Documentation about each exercise will be provided as I learn new things.

## Why is GitHub Important?

GitHub acts as a kind of "backup" of our projects so that it can easily be shared with others and of course, backed up. I like to think of the relationship between GitHub and coding like the relationship between Google Docs and school essays. When writing a school essay, it can be kind of risky to leave it stored locally. If your computer were to crash during your session or be lost, stolen, etc., you lose all access to your essay. Additionally, if you wanted to collaboratively work on your essay with another person, you would have to physically give them your computer. This is where Google Docs comes into play; Google Docs allows users to not only back up their work, but also share it with others so that it is easier to work as a team. Additionally, Google Docs has a slew of features that make writing documents even easier, such as word count, grammar checks, templates, and more!

GitHub serves as the kind of "Google Docs" of coding. It allows users to back up their work, invite others to contribute to the project (called repository, or "repo" for short), and comes with some features that make programming even easier, such as version control, pulling/pushing changes, repository documentation, and much more, all of which I will try to cover as I learn more. Hopefully, by this point you understand how crucial it is to be fluent in Git when programming, so let's create our first repository!

## How to Create a Repository

1. Creating the repository on GitHub

The first step is to create a repository (repo) on GitHub.
